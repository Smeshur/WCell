Welcome to my attempt at revitalizing the WoWCell Core.


Who knows, maybe I'll end up like the other 60+ forks of this core and only work on it for a short while.

I couldn't find anything significant past 2016.

I didn't bother forking any other repository or branch because if WCell/WCell/Master is in the most obviously working state I will use that.

I don't know that I plan to actually continue with the Original WCell codebase. Right now I am of the mind I will replicate a lot of the logic and understanding built into WCell. Perhaps as I learn more I will change my mind.

I love WoW Emulation, I've played/worked with Private servers since I was young, and I wish to see a fruitful project like this come back to life.

Plus I'm bored.
